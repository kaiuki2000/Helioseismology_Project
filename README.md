## Introduction
Welcome to the Helioseismology project repository! This project is part of an astrophysics laboratory class and focuses on computing the large and small separations of the Sun's radial oscillations spectrum. Helioseismology is a powerful tool for studying the Sun's interior, and this project will help you analyze its oscillations to gain insights into its structure and behavior.

## Project Description
In this repository, you will find code and resources to compute the large and small separations of the Sun's radial oscillations spectrum. The code is written in python and uses mesa_reader for data processing and analysis. It's designed to assist you in extracting meaningful information from the Sun's oscillation data.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/helioseismology-project.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any) using pip:

```bash
# Example for pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. You will need to have py_mesa_reader to run parts of the code. Check `py_mesa_reader` [here](https://github.com/wmwolf/py_mesa_reader) for instructions on how to install it.

## Usage
To run the code and analyze the Sun's oscillation data, simply run the provided jupyter notebooks.

## Data
This project may require specific datasets or input files to perform the analysis.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT license - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details.
